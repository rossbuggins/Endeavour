# Endeavour Pattern
Idempotent Promises

## Aims
- idempotency
- non guaranteed promise pattern, aka an endeavour
- RESTful(ish)
- Optional stateful status
- aspnetcore implementation

## A Promise, without the promise



## idempotency

## Status

## Basic Pattern

### Post

#### Request

/objectName/endeavour


Headers:

Endeavour-timeout: max time

Body:
Standard Json body

#### Response

Code: 202 Accepted

Headers:
Location: endeavour url




### Put

/object/endeavour/[endevourId]



### Get Status

/object/endeavour/[endevourId]

202 Accepted
Location: endeavour url

201 Created

Location header: resource url

### Get Status Stream

/object/endeavour/[endevourId]/stream

Returns a stream of status data until endeavour is complete or timeout reached.


### Get Resource 

Use location header from endeavour status when 201 created is returned.

# Optional centralised endeavours

GET endeavours/[endeavourId]

Used for managing endeavour status centrally.

## aspnetcore implementation

Endeavour launches are fully async.
Can await an endeavour until created is returned.

By default uses http stream.

Can optionally returned created resource.

By default uses the configured dotnet cache.

Uses middleware to look for endeavours and register routes.

Controllers can use generic Endeavour<T>

‘’’
[HttpPost]
Public async Task<Endeavour<T>> Post(T object)
‘’’

‘’’
[HttpPut]
Public async Task<Endeavour<T>> Put(Guid endeavourId)
‘’’

‘’’
[HttpGet]
Public async Task<Endeavour<T>> Get(Guid endeavourId)
